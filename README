gpgme library
=============
In order to build this framework, you need gpgme 0.3.0 or greater installed (and whatever version of GnuPG that requires; currently >= 1.0.6). To download and install it, proceed like this:

On MacOS X 10.1:
curl -O ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gpgme/gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz
curl -O ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gpgme/gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz.sig
gpg --verify gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz.sig
gnutar xzf gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz
cd gpgme-0.3.0

Then you need to apply a patch on the sources, available in GPGME framework
patch -p1 < path/to/gpgme.patch

./configure
mv libtool libtool.original
sed < libtool.original "s%-undefined suppress%-prebind -F/System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework -seg1addr 0x10000000%" > libtool
make
sudo make install
cd ..

On MacOS X Server 1.x (Rhapsody):
wget ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gpgme/gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz
wget ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gpgme/gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz.sig
gpg --verify gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz.sig
gnutar xzf gpgme-0.3.0.tar.gz
cd gpgme-0.3.0

Then you need to apply a patch on the sources, available in GPGME framework
patch -p1 < path/to/gpgme.patch

./configure
make
su root make install
cd ..

Installing GPGME framework (OR: Using It In Your Code)
=======================================================

In order to do anything useful with this framework you must install it. There are now 4 build styles, 2 of them are for stand-alone framework, the 2 others are for embedding the framework in your application (these are the ones you should use).
So, compile the framework using the EmbDevelopment or EmbDeployment Build Styles, then add a Copy Phase in your application's project to copy the GPGME.framework (located in your build products directory) in the Frameworks subdirectory of your application. See GPGTester settings to get an example or read Inside Mac OS X: System Overview.

If you prefer to have a standalone installed version of GPGME.framework (why would you do?), then use the Development or Deployment Build Styles. 
/Library/Frameworks is the default install location.
(Why? It's really hard to create a portable access path to ~/Library/Frameworks. Very easy to create one to /Library/Frameworks)

However, ProjectBuilder (as of ProjectBuilder 1.1.1) does not provide yet the -install- feature, you must use Terminal

On Mac OS X 10.1:
	(from within the GPGME directory)
	pbxbuild install -target GPGME DSTROOT=  //there is no typo here. It really is "DSTROOT="
	cd ..

	
Documentation generation
========================
HTML documentation can be generated automatically from code. For this you need to have installed autodoc in /usr/local/bin/, and its templates in one of the searched locations (see AutoDoc documentation).
To install AutoDoc, type the following commands in a terminal:

On MacOS X 10.1:
curl -O ftp://ftp.misckit.com/pub/next/misckit/AutoDoc-2.0b8-P-b.tar.gz
gnutar xzf AutoDoc-2.0b8-P-b.tar.gz
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
cd AutoDoc-2.0b8-P-b
sudo cp -p autodoc /usr/local/bin/
mkdir /Developer/AutoDoc/
cp -pR HTMLTemplate.html LaTeXTemplate.latex RTFTemplate.rtf /Developer/AutoDoc/
cd ..

To generate and install the documentation, choose target GPGME Documentation, and build; documentation will be installed in /Library/Documentation/GPGME
Note that if you use the Deployment Build Style for GPGME.framework, documentation will also be copied in GPGME.framework on install.
Tip: To view documentation within ProjectBuilder, open the files using File/Open..., and bookmark them with Navigation/Add to Bookmarks.


On MacOS X Server 1.x (Rhapsody):
wget ftp://ftp.misckit.com/pub/next/misckit/AutoDoc-2.0b8-OSXS-P-b.tar.gz
gnutar xzf AutoDoc-2.0b8-OSXS-P-b.tar.gz
Then install Makefiles following instructions in contrib/Makefiles/README

To generate and install the documentation, choose target
